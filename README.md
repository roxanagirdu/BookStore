###Getting Started###

Getting started with this repo.

####Familiar with Git?##### Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the process with the following:

	> git clone git@github.com:roxanagirdu/BookStore.git

	> cd BookStore

	> npm install

	> npm start
I've build an application that allows users to buy books.

For setup I've used my own boilerplate package, I didn't used codepen.io, because I created a structured app using different components, functional components and class based components.

Iâ€™ve used ES6 features like class, arrow functions, import and export statements, template strings.
Iâ€™ve build this app using only React. Iâ€™ve covered numerous React core topics, including JSX, components, state, props.
The application contains also some tests that can be run using:
	> npm test
